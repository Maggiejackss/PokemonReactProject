# Pokemon React App

The Pokemon React Project is my third and only solo project thus far. It utilizes 2 separate APIs in conjunction with React.JS and Redux to create a responsive application designed to allow the user to find their favorite Pokemons cards.

## Roadmap

- Create a search bar and filter section to allow for better navigation of the Pokemon available and their cards.

- Integrate support for generation 9 Pokemon.
